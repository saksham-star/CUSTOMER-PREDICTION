# CUSTOMER-PREDICTION
Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze customer data and build predictive models using classification, regression, and clustering techniques in IBM SPSS Modeler to understand customer behavior and predict future trends.
Tools and Technologies
• IBM SPSS Modeler
• IBM Cloud Pak for Data
• Customer.csv dataset
Methodology
The dataset was imported into IBM SPSS Modeler. Data preparation and cleaning were performed to ensure accuracy. Three models were built and evaluated:
1. Classification Model – to categorize customer outcomes.
2. Regression Model – to predict numerical customer metrics.
3. Clustering Model – to segment customers based on behavior patterns.
Results and Analysis
The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, correlation, and cluster quality. The classification model provided predictive insights into customer categories, the regression model predicted numerical outcomes effectively, and the clustering model revealed natural groupings within the customer base.
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the use of IBM SPSS Modeler for predictive analytics. By applying classification, regression, and clustering, valuable business insights were obtained that can help in customer targeting, behavior understanding, and marketing optimization.
